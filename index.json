Tariffs and mitigation Guide assumes current tariffs net of mitigation actions and a demand contingency of roughly 1% on organic sales. Local-for-local footprint and operating system actions are expected to offset tariff impacts. Portfolio actions and capital return Announced Sundyne acquisition; PPE exit expected in early May. Repurchased $3B of stock year to date and reaffirmed opportunistic buybacks. Tariffs and demand assumptions Management said tariff impacts are embedded in guidance with mitigation actions underway. Demand uncertainty is concentrated in short-cycle IA and some energy projects. Aerospace mix and margin OE revenue softness was attributed to mix and revenue recognition timing, not volume. Aero margins are expected to remain around the Q1 run rate for 2025. How much demand destruction is embedded in the 2025 guide? Management cited about a 1% organic sales impact with roughly $0.18 EPS headwind versus the February outlook. Why did aero OE revenue lag while volumes improved? Mix of cost-over-sale products and revenue timing drove the shortfall; volumes were up and management expects improvement later in the year. What is the timing for the planned separations? Advanced materials is targeted for late 2025/early 2026, with aerospace timing to be refined as regulatory steps progress. Local-for-local manufacturing reduces tariff exposure versus more globally exposed peers. Portfolio moves (Sundyne and PPE exit) continue to tilt Honeywell toward higher-margin, long-cycle end markets.

FY2026 guide: revenue $101B-$105B, EPS $9.3 +/- $0.25, ISG high-teens growth on $15B of AI shipments. Enterprise device refresh cycle evolving AI-driven infrastructure demand scaling Services and software attach expanding Pricing and cost pressure shaping margins Supply chain diversification improving resilience Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG) Revenue grew 22% to $11.4B; server and networking revenue rose 37% to $6.6B. Storage revenue increased 5% to $4.7B with strong PowerStore and PowerScale demand. Operating income rose 44% to $2.1B with a record 18.1% margin. Client Solutions Group (CSG) Revenue rose 1% to $11.9B; commercial revenue grew 5% while consumer declined 12%. Operating income was $600M (5.3% margin) on competitive pricing pressure. AI servers and backlog AI orders were $1.7B and shipments were $2.1B, with backlog ending at $4.1B. AI backlog expanded to about $9B as of February, with enterprise adoption rising. Capital return Raised annual dividend 18% to $2.10 per share and authorized an additional $10B buyback. Returned $10.8B since FY2023 inception through repurchases and dividends. FY2026 margin outlook Gross margin rate expected to decline about 100 bps on AI mix and competition. ISG margin guided roughly flat; CSG slightly down. FY2026 AI growth assumptions Guidance assumes at least $15B in AI shipments with continued pipeline expansion. Management sees supply improving but cites data center readiness constraints. Tariffs and pricing Management said new tariff announcements were not included in guidance. Tariff costs are treated as input costs with pricing actions as needed. How can ISG margins stay flat with AI mix growing? Dell expects storage leverage, Dell IP mix, and scale benefits to offset AI mix dilution. What is embedded in the FY2026 guide for AI shipments? Guidance assumes at least $15B in AI server shipments with pipeline multiples of backlog. Are tariffs included in the FY2026 outlook? Management noted new tariff announcements were not included and would be addressed via supply chain and pricing. Record ISG margins suggest Dell IP storage mix and AI services attach are scaling. FY2026 AI shipment target sets a higher bar for supply chain execution and customer readiness. CSG pricing remains competitive with consumer weakness and enterprise refresh pushed into H2. Track FY2026 AI shipment ramp versus $15B target. Monitor storage mix and margin contribution as Dell IP share grows. Watch PC refresh cadence ahead of Windows 10 end-of-life. Validate AI backlog conversion timing against Blackwell supply ramp. Check enterprise PC pipeline for refresh acceleration into H2 FY2026.

AI server margins were flat to slightly higher sequentially. PC refresh timing Commercial demand held up, but broader refresh pushed into calendar 2025. Windows 10 end-of-life remains a key catalyst. AI shipment timing Guidance implies Q4 AI shipments down slightly due to Blackwell transition timing. Pipeline growth reflects expanding enterprise and CSP demand. ISG margin durability Margin gains came from server mix, improved storage pricing, and operating leverage. Management expects further improvement in Q4. Why did full-year revenue guidance move lower despite a strong AI pipeline? PC refresh timing shifted later and AI demand shifted toward Blackwell, affecting near-term shipments. Is Q4 AI revenue expected to decline sequentially? Management indicated shipments would be slightly down sequentially based on Blackwell ramp timing. How is storage positioned for AI attach? Dell emphasized Dell IP storage, PowerStore and PowerFlex demand, and attach opportunities to AI deployments. Blackwell transition may create near-term AI shipment volatility but supports longer-term pipeline growth. ISG margin expansion suggests Dell is capturing higher-value AI services and storage attach.

ISG margins expected to improve with storage seasonality and mix. AI backlog and lead times Lead times vary by GPU platform and customer allocation, with H100 availability improving and H200/B200 ramping. Backlog remains NVIDIA-heavy and pipeline continues to grow.
