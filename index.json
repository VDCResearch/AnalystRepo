Memory pricing, bit growth, and 2026 mix DRAM ASP increased ~40% QoQ and NAND ASP increased mid-20% QoQ on higher market pricing and server-heavy mix; server SSD sales mix rose ~10 points QoQ. Samsung expects tight undersupply across HBM, conventional DRAM, and NAND, with multi-year supply requests increasing; mix may temporarily tilt toward server DDR versus HBM for profitability, while maintaining flexibility longer term. HBM4 roadmap and advanced packaging HBM4 entered final qualification phase, with stable full-scale production and shipments starting in February; capacity for 2026 is fully booked and HBM sales are expected to increase by more than 3x YoY. HBM4E: standard sampling planned around mid-2026 and custom HBM products planned in 2H26; Samsung indicated limited near-term demand for 16-high HBM3E/HBM4 as it targets 12-high HBM4E sampling, while progressing hybrid copper bonding (HCB) for selective commercialization. Foundry advanced-node pipeline and turnkey model 2nd-gen 2nm development is tracking to yield/performance targets with mass production targeted for 2H26; 1.4nm is targeted for 2029 with PDK v1.0 planned for 2H27. Management expects 2nm project awards to increase by 130% YoY (HPC/AI-led) and highlighted a \"one-stop\" turnkey model integrating design, foundry, memory, and advanced packaging. Shareholder returns and treasury share cancellations Samsung reported FY2025 free cash flow of ~KRW 36.5T; 50% of FCF (KRW 18.3T) is the basis for shareholder returns under its policy. Samsung plans KRW 9.8T in regular dividends plus KRW 1.3T additional dividends; of KRW 8.2T shares acquired in 2025, KRW 6.6T (excluding employee-related) is slated for cancellation with schedule disclosure in Q1 2026. How did DRAM and NAND pricing/bit shipments trend in Q4? Samsung said DRAM ASP rose ~40% QoQ and NAND ASP rose mid-20% QoQ on higher pricing and server mix; NAND bit growth declined QoQ due to base effects and process migration, while server SSD mix rose ~10 points QoQ. What is the status of HBM4 qualification and packaging (HCB/16-high)? HBM4 is in stable full-scale production with shipments starting in February; Samsung expects limited near-term demand for 16-high HBM3E/HBM4 while preparing HBM4E sampling (12-high) and selective HCB commercialization. What is Samsung's 2026 HBM sales outlook? Samsung expects 2026 HBM sales to increase by more than threefold year-on-year, with production-ready capacity fully booked and demand still exceeding supply. How is the foundry node roadmap progressing (2nm/1.4nm) and what is the customer pipeline? Samsung said 2nd-gen 2nm is tracking to targets with mass production targeted for 2H26; 1.4nm is targeted for 2029, and it expects 2nm project awards to rise 130% YoY, driven by HPC/AI demand. What is the shareholder return pool and what happens to repurchased shares? Samsung reported ~KRW 36.5T FY2025 free cash flow (KRW 18.3T return base) and plans KRW 9.8T regular dividends plus KRW 1.3T additional; KRW 6.6T of acquired shares is slated for cancellation with Q1 2026 schedule disclosure. VDC EMOB research highlights that shared-device frontline models are common; Samsung's push toward on-device \"agentic AI\" and Knox feature expansion should be evaluated through shared-user identity, session control, and app governance requirements (not just consumer UX). Samsung explicitly called out mobile BOM pressure from rising memory prices; this reinforces a 2026 EMOB risk of elongated refresh cycles, higher device TCO, and tighter supply for enterprise-grade Android handhelds/tablets that compete for components with AI/server demand. In EMOB, rugged-specialist OEMs (e.g., Zebra, Honeywell) retain differentiation via purpose-built scanning, hot-swap power, and long lifecycle support; Samsung's leverage is scale plus Knox security and AI roadmap that can cascade into enterprise SKUs. Samsung Networks highlighted vRAN/ORAN and new orders despite telco investment headwinds, which matters for private 4G/5G connectivity underpinning warehouse/field mobility deployments. Track memory pricing/allocation dynamics into 1H26 (Samsung noted customers securing supply) for impact on enterprise Android device BOMs and availability. Watch for Knox and Android Enterprise program updates tied to Galaxy S26 and foldables (shared device support, enrollment, kiosk/work profile improvements). Monitor foundry \"one-stop\" turnkey traction (logic + memory + packaging) as a potential differentiator for edge AI/industrial silicon roadmaps. Refresh 2026 connected-worker device cost assumptions for memory-driven BOM pressure and constrained supply. Track enterprise-facing Knox / Android Enterprise announcements tied to Galaxy S26 (shared-device workflows, compliance, and manageability). How quickly will \"agentic AI\" features become usable in shared-device and compliance-heavy frontline environments? Will memory price inflation meaningfully delay enterprise/rugged refresh cycles or shift mix toward service-based device programs? DS: HBM4 shipment ramp (Feb start), pricing/mix, and how quickly Samsung expands supply capacity versus demand. DX: profitability through Galaxy S26 launch and whether VD/DA losses narrow amid tariffs and competition."

Adjusted segment margin expanded to 26.5% (up 620 bps) largely due to the Bombardier agreement comparability; excluding that effect, adjusted margin declined ~60 bps on cost inflation. Industrial Automation Organic sales grew 1% as WWS rose 5% on pipeline conversion, sensing grew 3%, and PSS returned to growth (+1%) with double-digit orders; Process Solutions was flat as aftermarket services offset measurement and controls softness. Segment margin declined 120 bps to 18.4% due to cost inflation, partially offset by commercial excellence and benefits from the PPE sale; core Process Solutions will move to PA&T reporting in 2026. Building Automation Organic sales grew 8% (solutions +9% led by services; products +8%) with strength in North America and the Middle East; orders increased year over year and sequentially. Segment margin improved 20 bps to 27.0% on commercial excellence and volume leverage, partially offset by inflation. Energy and Sustainability Solutions Organic sales declined 7% on petrochemical catalysts reload softness; UOP orders grew on strong LNG demand and double-digit growth in refining and petrochemicals projects. Segment margin declined 300 bps to 23.7% on mix and cost inflation; ESS will be reported within PA&T starting in 2026. Portfolio actions and reporting changes Solstice Advanced Materials was spun off on October 30, 2025 (ticker: SOLS) and Advanced Materials is reported as discontinued operations. Following its strategic alternatives review, Honeywell classified PSS and WWS as held for sale (sale process planned for 1H 2026) to focus on core automation areas with long-term secular growth drivers. Starting in 2026, Honeywell will report Aerospace Technologies, Building Automation, Industrial Automation, and Process Automation and Technology (PA&T); PA&T will include UOP and core Process Solutions, and the businesses in ESS will be reported within PA&T. One-time items and Flexjet settlement Q4 operating income and GAAP EPS were pressured by a one-time impairment charge tied to the held-for-sale classification (PSS/WWS) and Flexjet-related litigation matter impacts. Honeywell and Flexjet reached a comprehensive agreement announced January 21, 2026, including an extension of aircraft engine maintenance through 2035; the company disclosed a one-time cash payment in Q1 2026 that is excluded from full-year free cash flow guidance. 2026 outlook perimeter 2026 guidance includes full-year expected results for Aerospace, PSS, and WWS and does not include the pending acquisition of Johnson Matthey's Catalyst Technologies business. Held-for-sale businesses and EMOB/warehouse exposure Investors focused on how the intended sale of PSS and WWS reshapes Honeywell's automation portfolio and near-term operating cadence while those businesses are held for sale. 2026 guidance assumptions and new reporting structure Management emphasized that 2026 guidance includes PSS and WWS for the full year and excludes the Catalyst Technologies acquisition, alongside a new PA&T segment that combines UOP and core Process Solutions. Aerospace growth and margin mix (BBD effect) Discussion centered on aerospace demand durability and the margin bridge between reported results and performance excluding the Bombardier agreement comparability. Sale process timing and stranded-cost execution Questions also centered on the timing for the PSS/WWS sales process and the pace of stranded-cost takeout as Honeywell prepares for the automation/aerospace separation. How does 2026 guidance treat PSS/WWS and the Catalyst Technologies acquisition? Guidance includes full-year expected results for Aerospace, PSS, and WWS and excludes the Johnson Matthey Catalyst Technologies acquisition. What is the expected timing for the PSS and WWS sale process? Honeywell indicated it intends to pursue a sale of PSS and WWS in the first half of 2026, with timing dependent on customary closing conditions and approvals. What milestones should investors track for the automation/aerospace separation? Honeywell reiterated expectations to separate automation and aerospace in Q3 2026 and announced elements of an aerospace leadership team ahead of the planned separation. What drove the large gap between GAAP and adjusted results in Q4? GAAP results reflected one-time impacts tied to the PSS/WWS held-for-sale classification and Flexjet-related litigation matters, which are excluded from adjusted results. The planned sale of PSS (AIDC/scanning + rugged mobility exposure) and WWS (warehouse workflow + voice) is a potential structural reset for the EMOB landscape: a separated asset could become a cleaner #2 EMOB comparable, but near-term customer/channel uncertainty could delay deployments and large refresh decisions. PSS returned to organic growth in Q4 (+1%) with double-digit order growth, and WWS grew 5% organically, signaling improving demand in core data capture and warehouse workflows even as Industrial Automation margins remain pressured by inflation. Honeywell's portfolio moves reinforce a broader industrial trend toward specialization; EMOB forecasts should treat Honeywell's current exposure as transitional until the divestiture perimeter and timing are clarified. Track how Honeywell and channel partners message roadmap continuity, support, and pricing for PSS/WWS during the held-for-sale period, as that will influence win/loss dynamics versus pure-play AIDC and warehouse automation vendors. Watch for updates on timing and structure of PSS/WWS divestitures (single buyer vs separate processes) and any interim operational dis-synergies that could affect demand and margins. Monitor PSS order trends and WWS pipeline conversion as leading indicators for EMOB and warehouse workflow spending through 2026. Track Aerospace margin progression excluding the Bombardier agreement effect as pricing catches up to cost inflation. Channel checks with AIDC resellers/integrators on customer demand, deal cycles, and any deferrals tied to PSS/WWS sale uncertainty. Track any updates on the 1H 2026 PSS/WWS sale process (structure, buyer type, and carve-out readiness) and update EMOB competitive scenarios accordingly. Refresh EMOB comparable-company framing once divestiture perimeter and standalone financial disclosures become clearer.

Tariffs and mitigation Guide assumes current tariffs net of mitigation actions and a demand contingency of roughly 1% on organic sales. Local-for-local footprint and operating system actions are expected to offset tariff impacts. Portfolio actions and capital return Announced Sundyne acquisition; PPE exit expected in early May. Repurchased $3B of stock year to date and reaffirmed opportunistic buybacks. Tariffs and demand assumptions Management said tariff impacts are embedded in guidance with mitigation actions underway. Demand uncertainty is concentrated in short-cycle IA and some energy projects. Aerospace mix and margin OE revenue softness was attributed to mix and revenue recognition timing, not volume. Aero margins are expected to remain around the Q1 run rate for 2025. How much demand destruction is embedded in the 2025 guide? Management cited about a 1% organic sales impact with roughly $0.18 EPS headwind versus the February outlook. Why did aero OE revenue lag while volumes improved? Mix of cost-over-sale products and revenue timing drove the shortfall; volumes were up and management expects improvement later in the year. What is the timing for the planned separations? Advanced materials is targeted for late 2025/early 2026, with aerospace timing to be refined as regulatory steps progress. Local-for-local manufacturing reduces tariff exposure versus more globally exposed peers. Portfolio moves (Sundyne and PPE exit) continue to tilt Honeywell toward higher-margin, long-cycle end markets.
